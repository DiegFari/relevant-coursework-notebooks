We developed the build_tree function to reconstruct the parse tree from the backpointer chart, making sure that it followed the correct recursive logic. We relied on GenAI for debugging and refining the code. We also consulted the TA to double-check the understanding of the alogirthm and the overall logic."

Also make sure that the predicted sense is applicable to a word token using [`wn.synsets()`](https://www.nltk.org/howto/wordnet.html).\n",

This can be done using a built-in function from NLTK (e.g. <code>wn.lemmas('run')[0]</code>). For more info about NLTK's WordNet API, check [this](https://www.nltk.org/howto/wordnet.html).\n",

This required some time, since we had to change the numbers and then calculate the correct answers to the problems. Ex 3.2 required even more time to run the code and fill in the table with the correct numbers. We had to verify both the model's answers and the intermediate reasoning steps. To manage this efficiently, we divided the work among us to simplify the process. Each group member worked on a question so we all were able to work on it, understand it and it took us less time. We used GenAI to check the code."

        "\n",
        "So far, we have seen how word vectors can be constructed from corpus statistics, and how they can be utilized to infer latent semantic content either in isolation (e.g. genders from names) or in relation to one another (e.g. similarities and analogies).\n",
        "\n",
        "For tasks involving larger linguistic units such as phrases, sentences and dialogues, we need machinery capable of processing _sequences_ or _structures_ of words.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are an example of such machinery. For this assignment, you will construct a recurrent neural network that will predict properties of the upcoming (not yet seen) text. You know this situation from language models, which try to predict the next word in a sequence given context. What language models do is provide a conditional probability distribution over the whole vocabulary of the upcoming word. Here, however, we will simplify our life. Rather than trying to predict the upcoming word, **we will construct a recurrent neural network that will predict the part-of-speech tag (POS tag) of the upcoming word.** That is, the network will build a conditional probability distribution over the full list of POS tags of the upcoming word given the preceding context.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's look at a few examples to make it clear what the model will be doing and to gauge intuion on how difficult this is. Sometimes, the task can be fairly easy. For instance, if the sentence starts as 'I want to...' then the next POS tag (the POS tag of the next word given this context) is very likely to be a verb in its base form (e.g., 'sleep'). Other times, it is harder. For instance, if the context is 'John left...' the continuation could be almost any POS tag, from the period (which has its own tag) to a preposition (as in 'John left at noon') through pronouns (as in 'John left us') to determiners (as in 'John left the city').\n",
        "\n",
        "This task can be seen as simplified case of using an RNN as a language model. A good reference point for RNNs as language models and for RNNs as labellers of POS tags is in Jurafsky and Martin [Chapter 13](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/13.pdf).\n",
        "\n",
        "You might wonder why anyone would bother modeling such prediction. One reason is that the resulting model can be seen as approximating human behavior, in this case, human behavior in reading and listening. It is a well-known fact that when we process text (or speech), we do not just passively wait for the incoming information. We are immediately interpreting and we predict what will be coming next. This prediction has various levels of abstraction: we might predict concrete words, but we also predict abstract properties of such words, such as gender or their phonological structures. The task that you do here can be seen as one step in this prediction process. We will try to see whether the resulting RNN model is in any way similar to humans.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will take a gradual approach, first inspecting recurrent neural networks, then moving on to data processing using high-grade word vectors before finally moving to the problem at hand.\n",

'Resigned' scores higher in the normal version of the sentence (and high for GP as well) since the model doesn't expect this word, likely since it is distant to banker and expects the sentence to go on about informed instead. With regard to the difference between the models: both models show similar surprisal values, but the LSTM model sometimes performs a bit better, while for some words the difference is small. This is most likely because the SRN model relies on local word occurrence instead of clause-level cues. In another case, for 'is', SRN performs better, most likely because SRN focusses on the local change more than LSTM."

Interesting difference is that with the SRN model, the surprise for 'passed' jumps up at D1 (7.46) and then goes down again for D2 (5.92) and D3 (4.84), while LSTM stays high after the initial jump (around 6 or 7). For LSTM this leads to the verb as last word is less surprising than '.', while SRN is more surprised of the verb than '.' in all embedded sentences.This indicates the LSTM is better able to keep track of the expected number of verbs required to finalise all (embedded) sentences than the SRN."

We also used ChatGPT to guide us when the output of our code wasn't as we expected, to show us what parts of the code were leading to these results. For example in assignment 10, we noticed that the code for c8.1 cut off the '.' when surprisal was calculated, after fixing this, it all worked. For this assignment, worked on it regularly outside of the lectures and texted about the plans.

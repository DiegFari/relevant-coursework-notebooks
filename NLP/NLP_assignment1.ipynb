        "- VB: The National Transportation Safety Board ruled that pilots failed to set the plane's wing flaps and slats properly for takeoff and failed to make mandatory preflight checks that would have detected the error.\n",
        "- VBD: Mr. Pearce set up GM's first in-house litigation group in May with four lawyers, all former assistant U.S. attorneys with extensive trial experience.  \n",
        "- VBN: A record date hasn't been set.\n",
        "- VBP: Another finding from the study: Prosecutors set significantly different priorities.\n",
        "- VBZ: Dreyfus moved to the $1 price after the SEC set standards -- an average 120-day maturity of high-grade paper -- that are still the rule.\n",
        "\n",
        "As for the word 'many', the less likely POS tag is VB 'verb base'. Example: Elected to Congress in 1978, the 48-year-old Mr. Courter is part of a generation of young conservatives who were once very much in the lead of the rightward shift under Mr. Reagan. -- We wish to highight that in this case the POS tag is worngly assigned to the word 'many': i.e. in this sentence 'many' does not serve as a verb.\n",
        "\n",
        "As for the word 'open', the less likely POS tag is RP 'particle'. Example: All major roadways except Interstate 880, known as the Nimitz Freeway, and the Bay Bridge were open by 1 p.m. yesterday. -- We wish to highight that in this case the POS tag is worngly assigned to the word 'open': i.e. in this sentence 'open' does not serve as a particle.\n",

Example: Because hurricanes can change course rapidly, the company sends employees home and shuts down operations in stages -- the closer a storm gets, the more complete the shutdown. -- We wish to highight that in this case the POS tag is worngly assigned to the word 'down': i.e. in this sentence 'open' does not serve as a verb non-3sg-pr.\n",

However, in the reported example the verb is indeed at the third person, but also at the past tense (which of course does not need a final 's' for the third sing. person). Still, we would have aspect this case to fall under the VBD POS tag (verb past tense) instead of under the VBZ tag.\n",
        "The other examples are quite predictable, perhaps we would expect the first example reported by us (POS tag JJ) to fall under the tag VBN (verb past participle).

This is because the smoothing process consists in redistributing probability mass to unseen N-grams, preventing zero probabilities. This effect affects more bigrams and especially trigrams, since they rely on rarer word sequences. As an example, in Sentence 1, trigram probabilities drop significantly (from 4.637e-15 to 1.161e-33), while unigrams show a smaller decrease (from 5.712e-24 to 5.114e-24).

An important aspect to note is that, since this is the test set, it certainly contains unseen n-grams, particularly in bigrams and trigrams. Therefore, the unsmoothed probabilities for these sequences are zero, as they were not encountered in the training data. In contrast, smoothing prevents zero probabilities, ensuring that even unseen n-grams retain a small but nonzero probability. This effect is evident in Sentence 2, where bigram and trigram probabilities are zero in the unsmoothed case but are assigned extremely small values when smoothed."

        "Probability and perplexity represent different types of data. Probabilities range from 0 to 1 and measure the likelihood of a sentence, while perplexity quantifies uncertainty—a higher perplexity suggests that the model finds the sentence less predictable. As a general rule, sentences with lower probability tend to have higher perplexity. This pattern is evident in sentences 1 and 2 from the training set: Sentence 1 has a higher probability than Sentence 2, and therefore its perplexity is significantly lower.\n",

This is one of the best-performing N-gram smoothing methods, and up to a few years ago, a popular implementation of it called [KenLM](https://kheafield.com/code/kenlm/) gave state-of-the-art results.\n",

The task then becomes to model $p(c_k\\mid c_{k-N-1}\\dots c_{k-1})$ where each $c_i$ is now an ASCII character instead of an entire word.\n",

Go ahead and read it if you haven't already: it is a superb introduction to the topic of Recurrent Neural Networks.\n",

        "Neural language models solve the problem of data sparsity in a different manner. Instead of estimating the probabilities $p(w_k\\mid w_{k-N-1}\\dots w_{k-1})$ by counting occurrences in the data, they use a neural network $f_{\\theta}$ parametrized by parameters $\\theta$ to predict this probability. The parameters $\\theta$ are learned through optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "The simplest approach goes like this: each word in the history $w_{k-N-1}\\dots w_{k-1}$ is embedded separately giving vectors $e_{k-N-1}\\dots e_{k-1}$ and then concatenated into one long vector $[e_{k-N-1};\\dots ;e_{k-1}]$. The network then uses this history vector to predict a probability distribution over words $w$ in the vocabulary $V$:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",

        "RNNs are a clever extension of this idea, where a hidden state vector $h$ is re-used and updated at each step $k$ in order to store the information of the entire history up to step $k-1$. That is, an RNN actually does away with the N-order approximation; it tries to model the full conditional directly! That means that\n",
